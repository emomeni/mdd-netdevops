# Model-Driven Devops Demo Repo

This is the base repo for Model-Driven devops demos. This branch has two topologies that can be used to show MDD from start to finish and assumes you will be using CML for both test and prod environments.

The prod topology is a fully configured network and requires the installation of NSO. The Test topology is a digital twin with no existing configuration. The intention of this repository is to replicate deploying MDD in an existing environment.
